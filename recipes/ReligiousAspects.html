<h1>Religious Philosophy</h1>

    The Frieren anime is unique for a lot of reasons. It's a breath of fresh air in the fantasy anime <strong>monolith</strong>. It tells a unique story with well developed characters. 
</p>
<p>
    On of my favorite aspects is the unique way in which it advocates for its characters faith. Often, characters aren't steadfast zealots who advocate for their religion only. Many of the religious characters have open minds and consider the possibility that their goddess may not exist. Take Eisen, a central character, who states that while the goddess may not exist, he is a devout follower, because it's <em>more convenient</em> that way. The other (non-religious) characters then join him in prayer, accepting his words.

    This isn't groundbreaking or anything, but I've never seen anything like that done in the fantasy genre, and Frieren is filled with moments like this.
